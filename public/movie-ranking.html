<h1>The Best Movies According to Alexis</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Pokemon 2000</h3>
<p>Good movie, but really sad.</p>

<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>My favorite Shrek movie. It was really funny. Not in his swamp.</p>

<h3>Pokemon: Rise of Darkrai</h3>
<p>
  Unironically the best movie ever. I grew up thinking the Lucario movie was
  peak, but then I saw the truth. I knew when they were showing just opening
  battles to set the premise of their setting, it was going to be badass. Like
  what do you mean I get to see every single leaf that rests upon a Torterra's
  back tree?!
